# Nirvana Tracker
 We give you a platform where you can journal your day and we use your words to decipher your moods and generate a graph and pattern of your mood swings.
 
 
## What does Our website do ##
And when time passes by and someday we pick up our diary and read what we had written we realize how our moods differed. And sometimes find the entries out of context but it does help peak in how we were feeling. 
Our website Nirvana Tracker has both abilities. It is an online journal website where you can write your heart out and at the same time, it gives you a report of your mood and helps you keep a check on how you are feeling. through this website we are also trying to create a community or a self-help group where you can talk to other people through chats. You can use this to let out what you have been feeling and gain a fresh perspective without the fear of being judged.

Our app is distinct from all other mood trackers on the market because:

We offer a free writing space where you don't have to analyse what you're feeling; instead, just write whatever comes to mind because some emotions can't be expressed as happy or sad. A person experiences a wide range of emotions, and it is difficult to recognise them while experiencing them. So the deciphering is our responsibility; all you have to do is vent on our website. On most other websites, you must select your emotions, which can be tedious at times.

We're also working on creating a community where you can talk to someone else, sort of like a human journal, but with the added benefit of actually discussing the problem and coming up with solutions while talking. This can evolve into a self-help group where people can come and vent their frustrations to others. Users may also find people who are in the same situation as them or have been in it before and learn how they dealt with it.
